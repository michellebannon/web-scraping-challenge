The strategy has evolved as we have learned more about Mars and as more questions have arisen. We have gone from “Follow the Water” to “Explore Habitability” to “Seek Signs of Life.”\n",

      "Astrobiology is a relatively new field of study, where scientists from a variety of disciplines (astronomy, biology, geology, physics, etc.) work together to understand the potential for life to exist beyond Earth. However, the exploration of Mars has been intertwined with NASA’s search for life from the beginning. The twin Viking landers of 1976 were NASA’s first life detection mission, and although the results from the experiments failed to detect life in the Martian regolith, and resulted in a long period with fewer Mars missions, it was not the end of the fascination that the Astrobiology science community had for the red planet.\n",
      " \n",
      "The field of Astrobiology saw a resurgence due to the controversy surrounding the possible fossil life in the ALH84001 meteorite, and from the outsized public response to this announcement, and subsequent interest from Congress and the White House, NASA’s Astrobiology Program (https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/ )and one of its major programs, the NASA Astrobiology Institute (https://nai.nasa.gov/ ) were formed.\n",
      " \n",
      "Also at this time, NASA’s Mars Exploration Program began to investigate Mars with an increasing focus on missions to the Red Planet. The Pathfinder mission and Mars Exploration Rovers (Spirit and Opportunity) were sent to Mars to “Follow the Water,” recognizing that liquid water is necessary for life to exist on Earth. After establishing that Mars once had significant amount of water on its surface, the Mars Science Laboratory (which includes the Curiosity rover) was sent to Mars to determine whether Mars had the right ingredients in the rocks to host life, signaling a shift to the next theme of “Explore Habitability”. MEP is now developing the Mars 2020 rover mission (https://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mars2020/ ) to determine whether life may have left telltale signatures in the rocks on Mars’s surface, a further shift to the current science theme “Seek the Signs of Life”.\n",
      " \n",
      "Finding fossils preserved from early Mars might tell us that life once flourished on this planet. We can search for evidence of cells preserved in rocks, or at a much smaller scale: compounds called biosignatures are molecular fossils, specific compounds that give some indication of the organisms that created them. However, over hundreds of millions of years these molecular fossils on Mars are subject to being destroyed or transformed to the point where they may no longer be recognized as biosignatures. Future missions must either find surface regions where erosion from wind-blown sand has recently exposed very ancient material, or alternately samples must be obtained from a shielded region beneath the surface. This latter approach is being taken by the ExoMars rover (http://exploration.esa.int/mars/48088-mission-overview/ ) under development where drilled samples taken from a depth of up to 2 meters will be analyzed.\n",

    "So the link here is a Tag object and what we basically have is we  have all of our a tags that have an attribute of href and also have an http match within them.  It isn't useful for you to have this result stuck within Jupyter notebook though so you will want to know how to save this as an external file.  To do that we're going to create a new text file called parse data, and so were' going to create file variable and we are going to say, we want to open a new file called parsed_data.txt it's going to ba a text file and we want to write into that text file. So we're going to pass in a w parameter and then what we want to do is for each of the links that was just printed out we want to print those now into the parsed_data text file. So we will copy the code from above: for link in soup.findAll('a', attrs={'href': re.compile(\"^http\")}):\n",
    "    print(link) \n",
    "and it's performaing the same operations now as it did before but instead of printing here into jupyter, it's going to go ahead and it's going to generate a Soup link and thats going to be a string. So instead of printing the link it's going to create a new variable called soup_link and that link is going to be equal to a string and this string is going to be derived from each link within the Soup object, and so for each soup_link we just want to print that out. So we are going to say print soup_link and we are going to write it into the file so we're going to say file.write, we're going to pass in what we want written which is going to be the soup_link and what this loop is going to do is it's going to pass it the entiore BeautifulSoup object and it's going to find all of the links and print them out until it finds no more links and then it is going to flush the file and close the file. To make that happen we are going to say file.flush() and file.close"
