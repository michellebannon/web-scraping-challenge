    "So the link here is a Tag object and what we basically have is we  have all of our a tags that have an attribute of href and also have an http match within them.  It isn't useful for you to have this result stuck within Jupyter notebook though so you will want to know how to save this as an external file.  To do that we're going to create a new text file called parse data, and so were' going to create file variable and we are going to say, we want to open a new file called parsed_data.txt it's going to ba a text file and we want to write into that text file. So we're going to pass in a w parameter and then what we want to do is for each of the links that was just printed out we want to print those now into the parsed_data text file. So we will copy the code from above: for link in soup.findAll('a', attrs={'href': re.compile(\"^http\")}):\n",
    "    print(link) \n",
    "and it's performaing the same operations now as it did before but instead of printing here into jupyter, it's going to go ahead and it's going to generate a Soup link and thats going to be a string. So instead of printing the link it's going to create a new variable called soup_link and that link is going to be equal to a string and this string is going to be derived from each link within the Soup object, and so for each soup_link we just want to print that out. So we are going to say print soup_link and we are going to write it into the file so we're going to say file.write, we're going to pass in what we want written which is going to be the soup_link and what this loop is going to do is it's going to pass it the entiore BeautifulSoup object and it's going to find all of the links and print them out until it finds no more links and then it is going to flush the file and close the file. To make that happen we are going to say file.flush() and file.close"
